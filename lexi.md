### About Me.

Hello there! I am Alexia (pronounced ah-LEK-see-ah / IPA: /ɐlˈɛksi‍a/) and I currently work as a Systems Administrator (RHCSA, EX RH200) full time, OpenShift admin (DO180) and working with some 
large-scale devOps projects in the financial sector.

I began my Linux journey at a very young age, an accidental career path that some might find rather unusual for a teenage girl. However, what many people might not be aware of is that my passion for 
computers and technology took root much earlier, back in the late eighties. It all began when I first laid my hands on a Commodore 64. I was taught by my father the basic routines I had to type in order 
to launch games which later on I learned I was actually executing BASIC language stuff. These early experiences laid the foundation for my enduring love for technology and set me on a lifelong journey 
of exploration and learning.

Information Technologies is definitely one of my biggest interests and where I focus most of my energy on a daily basis, but I also love sports. I am an athlete and a footballer. And a huge footy fan, 
the kind that goes into the stadium in her team’s colours and shouts and cheers and sings with random people in the crowd. We (River Plate fans) are a huge family.

While it is true that my life revolves around IT, my academical background has very little to do with Linux, or Information Technologies, actually.

I studied Psychology, Law, Journalism and Language. Looking in retrospect, the value brought by interdisciplinary learning and how it influenced my career’s trajectory is something today I embrace as it 
has helped me tremendously expanding my universe and building an IT career in a very distinctive way.

Now a days I am invited quite frequently to present and give talks at conferences, events and universities, where I usually share topics I am deeply passionate about such as IT history, Linux, 
Electronics and Legacy Systems, and I get to mix them up with a bit of sociology, psychology and a scientific approach in general, for an extra bit of fun and cultural impact.

I currently serve as an ambassador for Women In Technology, an NGO dedicated to mentoring women students in their pursuit of initial roles within the IT sector. Additionally, I actively contribute as a 
member of the Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation, the driving force behind Rocky Linux —an Open Enterprise Linux Operating System.

My youtube channel, La Chica de Sistemas, which would vaguely translate to “That Tech Support Chick” is my most recent experiment where I deliver highly educational content in a very simple, friendly 
and humorous manner. The analytics for the channel have consistently been in the green for the last 8 months or so and experiencing exponential growth. The response from the audience has been nothing 
short of amazing.

During my leisure time I enjoy recreational coding, swimming, cycling and writing fiction and essays.
